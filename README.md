DEEP Open Catalogue: Massive Online Data Streams
==============================

[![Build Status](https://jenkins.indigo-datacloud.eu/buildStatus/icon?job=Pipeline-as-code/DEEP-OC-org/mods/master)](https://jenkins.indigo-datacloud.eu/job/Pipeline-as-code/job/DEEP-OC-org/job/mods/job/master/)

This work challenges [proactive network monitoring](https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2968718) for security and protection of computing infrastructures. The principle of the anomaly detection for security lies in proactive prediction from time-series using prediction models based on artificial neural networks, concretely deep learning models. These models are capable to predict next step(s) in near future based on given current and past steps. The intelligent module is built as a machine learning application leveraging deep learning modeling in order to enhance functionality of intrusion detection system (network IDS) supervising network traffic flows.
