------------
<p>Project based on the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/indigo-dc/cookiecutter-data-science">DEEP DS template</a>. #cookiecutter #datascience</p>

## Workflow
### Data Preprocessing module
1. Data cleaning and filtering, feature extraction
2. Data transformation, ML/DL datapool creation 
3. Feature selection

### Deep Learning module (MODS)
1. Configuration setting 
2. Model training
3. Model testing

### Prediction and train throught [DEEPaaS API](https://github.com/indigo-dc/DEEPaaS)
